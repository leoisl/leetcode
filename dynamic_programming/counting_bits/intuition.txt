Intuition:
I got the number 2000 and transformed it into binary: 0b11111010000. One way to divide the problem into subproblems, is to split this number in two parts, one containing the most significant bit (which is always 1 in this variable-length representation) and the rest, e.g.: 0b1 and 0b1111010000. The number of bits in 2000 is thus 1 + number_of_bits(0b1111010000) = 1 + number_of_bits(976). This "rest" (976) is n-2^logn. Generalising: number_of_bits(n) = 1 + number_of_bits(n-2^logn).
